Interactive visualisation of the data over the whole data. 


> **Settings**

The `overlay` allows to visualise  all time courses together with the average and standard error/deviation calculated for each group at each time point. Optionally:

1. set the minimum and maximum scale for the y-axis;
2. force the time scale t start at 0. A nominal tumour size value can also be specified in the `y at t0` box (``default: minimum observed measurement in the TC graphed``). Note that this option is not carried along to any subsequent analyses.


> **Output and interpretation**


Overlay plot can be exported in form of `SVG` and `PNG`.
