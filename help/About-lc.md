Interactive visualization of the data over the whole time course. 


> **Settings**

The `overlay` allows to visualize individual time courses together with the average and/or standard error/deviation calculated for each group at each time point.  Optionally:

1. set the minimum and maximum scale for the y-axis;
2. force the time scale t start at 0. A nominal tumor size value can also be specified in the `y at t0` box (``default: minimum observed measurement in the TC graphed``). Note that this option is not carried along to any subsequent analyses.


> **Output and interpretation**


The final overlay plot can be exported in form of `SVG` and `PNG`. Note that in the .svg file, points belonging to the same animal are pre-grouped for latter use in Software such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.
